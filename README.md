# Functions
# Functions are sub programs in python
# A function contains a block of code to be executed when it is called.
# We can write any number of functions in our program
# A function can be called any number of times.
# If a function is defined but not called, it won't work
# The order of function definition is not the order of getting output
# The order in which you are calling the function in your program will give you the result
# A function can be called inside another function
